# MGGCF
Multi-Graph Group Collaborative Filtering
---
This is our Tensorflow implementation for the paper:Multi-Graph Group Collaborative Filtering
## Introduction
---
Multi-Graph Group Collaborative Filtering is a new group recommendation method based on graph neural network.
## Environment Requirement
---
The  MGGCF code has been tested running under Python 3.6. The required packages are as follows:
+ tensorflow == 1.8.0
+ numpy == 1.14.3
+ scipy == 1.1.0
+ sklearn == 0.19.1

Copy data file folder to the corresponding method like MGGCF or AGREE.
